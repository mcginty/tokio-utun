# tokio-utun

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/tokio-utun)

This crate is a tokio wrapper for the utun interface (userspace tunnel) used by macOS.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokio-utun = "0.6"
```

## Notice

This is a work-in-progress with documentation and further testing and features a TODO.

## Usage

There is only one export, `UtunStream`. I don't recommend using this unless you're ready to
debug it on your own.
